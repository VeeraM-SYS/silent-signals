# Silent Signals 📶

**The Ultra-Dynamic EdTech Feedback Platform**

Silent Signals is a real-time, non-verbal feedback tool designed for modern classrooms (virtual and physical). It enables students to signal their status ("Confused", "Too Fast", "All Clear") instantly and discreetly, allowing instructors to adapt their pace dynamically.

Built with **Flutter** and **Riverpod**, featuring a premium **Glassmorphism** design system.

## ✨ Features

### For Students ("The Pulse")

- **Dynamic Animations**: Pulse and ripple effects using `flutter_animate` and custom tweens.
- **Privacy First**: Signals are aggregated anonymously.

### For Faculty ("The Command Center")
- **Bento Grid Dashboard**: A responsive, data-rich layout that adapts to any screen.
- **Real-time Heatlines**: Visualizing confusion trends over time with glowing gradient charts.
- **Instant Insights**: At-a-glance metrics for class comprehension.
